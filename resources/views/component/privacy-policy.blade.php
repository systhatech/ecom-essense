                    <h6>Why you Need a Privacy Policy?</h6>
                    <p>
                    Privacy is not a new concept. Humans have always desired privacy in their social as well as private lives. But the idea
                    of privacy as a human right is a relatively modern phenomenon.
                    
                    Around the world, laws and regulations have been developed for the protection of data related to government, education,
                    health, children, consumers, financial institutions, etc.
                    
                    This data is critical to the person it belongs to. From credit card numbers and social security numbers to email
                    addresses and phone numbers, our sensitive, personally identifiable information is important. This sort of information
                    in unreliable hands can potentially have far-reaching consequences.
                    
                    Companies or websites that handle customer information are required to publish their Privacy Policies on their business
                    websites. If you own a website, web app, mobile app or desktop app that collects or processes user data, you most
                    certainly will have to post a Privacy Policy on your website (or give in-app access to the full Privacy Policy
                    agreement).
                    
                    There are several reasons for a website to post its Privacy Policy agreement on its website.
                    
                    Here are some of the main reasons:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>- Required by the law</li>
                        <li>- Required by third party services</li>
                        <li>- Increases Transparency</li>                        
                    </ul>                  
                    
                 
                    <p>Let's take a look at each of these reasons in more depth.</p>
