                <p>With a few exceptions, we will reimburse you for returned items in the same way you paid for them. If you prefer, you
                can make an exchange for the same item.
                
                For returns by mail, once we receive your return, we will process it within 7â€“10 business days. Depending on your bank's
                processing time, it may take up to 10 days after we process the return to reflect on your account.
                
                If you paid more than $800 in cash or more than $250 by check or by a debit card without a major credit card logo, we
                will refund you by check within 10 business days. Any amounts deducted from a gift card will be credited to the gift
                card. If you no longer have the gift card used for an order, please call us at 1-888-BEST BUY (1-888-237-8289) with your
                order number handy, and we'll be happy to send you a replacement.</p>
